# [[Seivara]]

The sailors who claim to have seen its coastline describe a wall of green so dense it looks like the sea simply ends at a forest. 
## Description

[[Seivara]] is a vast continent of ancient jungle and old-growth forest, located far enough from [[Korlornium]] that it exists at the edge of legend. Its interior is largely unknown to outsiders — maps of it are either blank or filled with the guesses of cartographers who have never been there.

The continent has no kings, no churches, and no organized religion. Authority here belongs to the land itself. Every river, grove, mountain ridge, and tidal pool is inhabited by a nature spirit — ancient, inscrutable beings that the peoples of [[Seivara]] call the **Ara**. The elves and pixies who live across the continent exist in constant, careful negotiation with these spirits. You do not command or pray to an Ara. You leave an offering, you speak plainly, and you hope what lives in that place finds you worth answering.

The idea of a structured pantheon — gods with temples, hierarchies, and priests who speak on their behalf — is foreign to [[Seivara]]'s peoples and regarded with suspicion. Power belongs to the land, not to beings who claim to sit above it.

## Peoples

[[Seivara]] is home primarily to [[Elf|elves]] and [[Pixies]], who have lived among the Ara for as long as either can remember. There is no central government or ruling body — communities organize around groves, watersheds, and the particular spirits that inhabit them. Political borders mean little here.

That said, some groups carry more weight than others. Elven grove elders who have spent generations in communion with a powerful Ara command enormous respect across wide territories. Pixie courts — loosely organized but fiercely territorial — can mobilize quickly when their lands are threatened. These figures are not rulers in any formal sense, but when they speak, communities tend to listen.

It is rumored that the elves encountered elsewhere in [[Erodas]] — including those in [[Korlornium]] — are descendants of those who left [[Seivara]] long ago, though the reasons for their departure are not agreed upon.

## The Ara

[[The Ara]] are not gods in any sense that [[Korlornium]]'s people would recognize. They do not have temples or followers. They do not grant boons in exchange for worship. They are simply what lives in places — ancient, present, and indifferent to those who do not make an effort to be known to them. Some Ara are benign and communicative; others are territorial and strange. A forest that has been burned will have a different Ara than the one that lived there before.

## In Korlornium

[[Seivara]] is spoken of in [[Korlornium]] the way distant things are always spoken of — with exaggeration, reverence, and a comfortable vagueness. Scholars debate its exact location. Sailors argue about its coastline. No one the party has met has actually been there.
