# [[Dragonborn]]

[[Dragonborn]] are humanoid species with features resembling [[Dragon|Dragons]]. They originate from the continent [[Dracofold]] but are found all over [[Erodas]].

## Description

Dragonborn are humanoids of draconic descent native to [[Dracofold]]. They carry the physical mark of their ancestry in scaled skin, elongated features, and a breath weapon that varies by lineage. They are broadly distributed across [[Erodas]], most having emigrated from [[Dracofold]] over generations — some as refugees from [[Tiamat]]'s rule, others as traders, mercenaries, or exiles.

## On Dracofold

In [[Dracofold]], Dragonborn live as vassals under chromatic dragon lords who answer to [[Tiamat]]. They are not slaves outright, but the distinction is fine. Tribute, labor, and loyalty are the price of survival. Those who prosper do so by making themselves useful to their draconic overlords.

The **[[Ashen Communion]]** — a seasonal ritual in which communities drank diluted [[Cinderbloom]] nectar to honor their draconic ancestry — was central to Dragonborn cultural identity for generations. [[Tiamat]] banned it when she commercialized the Cinderbloom harvest. Practicing it now carries a death sentence in [[Dracofold]]. Many Dragonborn in exile still observe a stripped-down version quietly, without the Cinderbloom.

## In Korlornium

Dragonborn are uncommon in [[Korlornium]] but not unknown, particularly in port cities like [[Stormveil]] and [[Dithoria City]]. They tend to be regarded with a mix of wariness and curiosity — the association with [[Dracofold]] and its draconic rulers is not forgotten, even for those whose families left generations ago.
